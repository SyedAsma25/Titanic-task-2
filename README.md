# Titanic Visualization Project

This project shows some graphs and stats about the Titanic dataset.

---

## What I Did
1. Showed survival counts (how many survived and not).
2. Compared survival by **Sex** and **Class**.
3. Plotted **Age distribution** and **Fare distribution**.
4. Made a **heatmap** to see correlations.

---

## Stats I Found
- Around 38% of people survived.
- Women survived much more than men.
- 1st class passengers had higher survival than 3rd class.
- Kids had better survival chances.

---

## Patterns
- **Females > Males** in survival.  
- **Rich (1st class) > Poor (3rd class)** in survival.  
- **Younger > Older** in survival.
